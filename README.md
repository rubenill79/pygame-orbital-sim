PyPI PyPI - License PyPI - Python Version

A customisable and interactive Python simulation build over PyGame that models the orbits of celestial bodies in 2D space using Newton’s law of universal gravitation!

You can choose from several included preset arrangements.

Precise positioning and movement vectors are obtained through built-in access to JPL’s HORIZONS system, a resource that provides precise data for objects in our solar system.
